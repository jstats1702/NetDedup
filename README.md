Code for "A Bayesian Approach for De-duplication in the Presence of Relational Data"

In this paper, we study the impact of combining profile and network data in a de-duplication setting. We also assess the influence of a range of prior distributions on the linkage structure. Furthermore, we explore stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods as a faster alternative to obtain samples from the posterior distribution for network parameters. Our methodology is evaluated using the RLdata500 data, which is a popular dataset in the record linkage literature.
